Had a fantastic time connecting with 35+ PhD students from imec MIDA & UPM groups!  Truly inspiring to exchange progress and future outlooks with such a talented crowd.

## Presented our work on wetting characterization 
We found that higher nanostructure density significantly raises the barrier for complete wetting, increasing air-trapping risks. Surprisingly, the actual liquid surface tension needed for wetting is much lower than models predict! 

## Wetting models in nano-scale? 
This discrepancy hints at hidden dynamic mechanical barriers governing liquid behavior at the nanoscale. It’s not just about static models — the dynamic forces are real and tricky!

## The crowd favorite! 
Our in-situ 3D surface chemical analysis platform based on ATR spectroscopy!  It grabbed a lot of attention (and snaps!). Great consensus that chemical analysis on patterned surfaces has many "fancy stories" waiting to be told.
