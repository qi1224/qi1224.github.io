Excited to share my milestone & an inspiring experience meeting so many brilliant minds!

##  Opening the Door to UCPSS 2025
I recently attended the [Symposium on Ultra Clean Processing of Semiconductor Surfaces (UCPSS) 2025][ucpss-2025], where I had the opportunity to give an oral presentation on our recent work focusing on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposition and the characterization of their quality. The symposium brought together leading researchers and industry experts in ultra-clean processing and surface preparation technologies, providing an excellent platform for in-depth discussions on current challenges and emerging trends in semiconductor fabrication.

##  SAMs in the Spotlight
During the meeting, I engaged with many scholars and industrial scientists, and it became clear that SAMs are attracting significant attention for their role in advanced patterning techniques, particularly in area-selective etching and deposition processes. The ability of a SAM to form a dense, well-organized monolayer makes it an attractive candidate for high-resolution masking, offering the potential to precisely define functional areas at the nanoscale. However, despite these advantages, SAMs remain a double-edged sword. Their self-assembly properties are highly sensitive to surface conditions, and achieving uniform coverage on structured or high-aspect-ratio surfaces continues to be challenging.

##  Characterization Challenge
A major point of consensus among participants was that characterization of SAMs, especially on complex or patterned surfaces, is still limited. While traditional techniques can provide information on chemical composition or average coverage, they often fail to capture local variations in monolayer density or order. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when SAMs are applied on structured surfaces, where topography and nanoscale features can strongly influence assembly behavior. Our work aimed to address this gap by exploring initial strategies for evaluating SAM quality on structured substrates. We investigated approaches to quantify deposition uniformity and monolayer density, combining complementary techniques to gain a more complete understanding of how SAMs behave under realistic processing conditions.

##  Bridging Potential and Practice
The discussions at UCPSS 2025 highlighted that while SAMs are widely recognized for their potential in enabling next-generation semiconductor processing, advancing their practical application requires both improved deposition strategies and enhanced characterization capabilities. There is growing interest in developing in situ and high-resolution methods capable of probing monolayer structure on complex surfaces, which could provide critical insights for optimizing selective masking and improving process reliability.

## Inspiration for the Future
Attending this symposium reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue. Insights from both academia and industry are essential for addressing the dual challenge posed by SAMs: exploiting their dense, self-assembled nature while overcoming the difficulties associated with precise characterization. Our contributions, though preliminary, represent a step toward bridging this gap. I left the meeting inspired by the breadth of research in the field and the opportunities for further innovation in SAM-based surface engineering.
