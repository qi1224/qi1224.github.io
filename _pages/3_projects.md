#### In the frame of the Ph.D. project
<small>KU Leuven & imec, Leuven, Belgium</small>
<small>2022 - 2026</small>

•	Developed a custom ATR‑FTIR platform for real‑time wetting characterization of patterned surfaces. Built analytical + experimental frameworks for quantitative spectra interpretation.

•	Designed optical alignment, fluidic control, and automated data‑acquisition routines; technology extended into an internal patent application for semiconductor process monitoring.

•	Evaluated density of silane monolayers on nanopatterned Si using wetting characterization to quantify the CVD process window. Work received the Best Student Paper Award, UCPSS 2025.

•	Upgraded the conventional contact-angle system by integrating a dual‑axis imaging module and image‑processing scripts, enabling quantitative analysis of anisotropic droplet spreading on nano‑grooved surfaces.

•	Conducted wettability studies on high‑aspect‑ratio patterns, correlating surface geometry with wetting transitions and anisotropic wetting behavior.

#### Internship
<small>Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL), Amsterdam, the Netherlands</small>
<small>Sep. - Dec. 2021</small>

•	Performed mechanical simulations to model stress and strain in elastomer microstructure arrays used in low‑wear wafer carriers.

•	Collaborated with cleanroom specialists in an industrial‑research environment.
